# Answer project

Website operating script study - written mainly in PHP - for simple and small
things that definitely won't need to scale.


## What to expect from the code

- Inconsistent, experimental material.
- Extensively unfinished.
- It is in the need of a complete rewrite.


### Should you use it for anything?

It's likely that you wouldn't want to; this project is so early in its
development process that:

- it yet contains a range of suboptimalities that restrain productive usage,
- fixes and improvements might be added in a non-backward-compatible manner:
  - any effort based on an early instance of this codebase might end up isolated
    from future improvements, and thus possibly become deprecated very quickly.


## Maintenance and development

- Details about future maintenance and development can not be known.
  - Note: suggestions and dialogue are always preferred over out-of-the-blue
    pull requests.
- Consider it a development snapshot; expect non-backward compatible changes any
  time.


## Documentation

- [Installation guide][doc-install]
- [Operating manual][doc-ops] (jump-links to anchors don't work when viewed on
  GitHub.)
- [Development backlog][dev-bkglog]
- [Planning of next main version][dev-next-v]


## About the name

- "Answer" as in answer to the situation where I didn't find any related
  existing project with wich I could have felt satisfied enough.
- Also, I came accross the word originally by wanting to call the project
  "Structured Answer Over HTTP" (which idea I have dropped later).
