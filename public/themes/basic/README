## NOTES:

- "The most maintainable code is that hasn't been written."
- "Tiny Bootstraps" from Dave Rupert:

  Interpret it as _not_ a Twitter Bootstrap framework instance, but as a custom
  set of rules that are custom-picked and developed for the current client/
  website and work together as smart as Twitter Bootstrap does - except for for
  the fraction of the code volume/complexity.
