All website instances and all themes can link up things from this directory,
if they want.

I am not being very advanced with this one:
- I don't want to install Sass/Compass globally.
- I don't want to get into Grunt/Gulp on this project (I don't know them).
- So I generate the .css files in a theme where I have Bundlerized Sass/Compass
  set up, and then copy them over here manually. Until I find out if
  Sass/Compass can be configured to put them here, or till I write a shell
  script to do it...
