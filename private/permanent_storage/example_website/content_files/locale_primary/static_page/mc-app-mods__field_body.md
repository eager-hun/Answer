In my opinion, owners of websites not only should be able to identify at least some of those aspects of their websites that would benefit from improvement, but they should also be enabled to keep track of these observations.

In an ideal scenario, the creator of the website would provide an issue tracking system for managing these topics. Nevertheless, as a fallback, a privately available page like this could be prepared for plain note-taking.
