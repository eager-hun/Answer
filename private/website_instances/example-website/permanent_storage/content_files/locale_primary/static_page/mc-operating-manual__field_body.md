## <span class="anchor" id="anchor--website-instances"></span> Working with "website instances"

This application can hold definitions and content for multiple websites at the same time.

Out of the website definitions, only one can be used at a time: the chosen instance's name needs to be set in the app configuration. At the time of writing, the app cannot behave as a true multisite installation; in other words, regardless of any request parameter, the website instance being served will always be the one selected in the configuration.

This repository contains only one website instance, called "**example-website**". (Update: there is a prototyping-related site instance in the making.)

### Adding a new website instance to an installation

Website definitions and contents - by default - are located in the `/private/website_instances/` directory.

Each instance's directory needs to contain specific subdirectories and files, whose being missing could trigger errors of various severity.

While the documentation of the mandatory structure/content of website instance definitions is missing, a practical approach can be to "clone" an existing example instance, and modify that one:

1. Duplicate (copy) the `example-website` directory, renaming the duplicate directory's name to the desired name of your new site instance,
2. Update the new instance's `config.php` with the new site's configuration.
3. Set the active `website_instance` in `director.php`'s `@ingroup configuration`.
4. Check if everything works, and you have a working 'clone' of the
   `example-website`.
5. You can start modifying the definition- and content-related files of your
   instance to reflect your wishes.


## <span class="anchor" id="anchor--bare-data-mode"></span>Using the bare data mode

Bare data mode can return a single entity or a binder (a set of entities) without the page and the theme around it. It is a potentially valuable capability for the future, but is also useful in checking/debugging the setup of binders/entities at their most core level.

By default, the bare data mode can be accessed on the `/bare-data` path (this value can be overridden from config).

The bare data mode operates by, and is expecting HTTP GET parameters:

- `data_type` (mandatory)
  - Valid values are: `entity` or `binder`.
- `entity_type` (mandatory for entities)
- `instance_id` (mandatory)
- `present_as` (optional)
  - The default `presentation_agent` is `automatic_inventory`. Note: not all
    entity types and `presentation_agent`s are compatible.
- `output_type` (optional)
  - Defaults to `html`, the other valid option would be `json`, which, though,
    doesn't do much, as this feature is not finished yet.

### Bare data mode examples

**NOTE:** The following links will work only on a site that is running on a server (not on GitHub), and is serving the `example-website` site instance, and the `bare_data` mode is enabled for the given environment (see the _Config presets_ section in the active website instance's config.php).

- [a binder]([[base_path]]bare-data?data_type=binder&amp;instance_id=footer_default)
- [an article with all of its defined data]([[base_path]]bare-data?data_type=entity&amp;entity_type=article&amp;instance_id=article-1)
- [same article's preview presentation mode]([[base_path]]bare-data?data_type=entity&amp;entity_type=article&amp;instance_id=article-1&amp;present_as=article_preview)


## <span class="anchor" id="anchor--adding-new-content"></span>Adding new content

**NOTE:** _all_ changes _all_ the time should be made on an isolated development machine, then the new and updated files should be copied to the public server.

This is neccessary because authoring content needs **admin&nbsp;tasks** to be used,
but these **admin&nbsp;tasks should be disabled on the public server** (because the
site _cannot make difference_ between administrators and regular visitors: and we don't
want just anybody to be able to access the admin tasks).

<!--/HIGH-->

<!--NOTE-->

The following steps need to be carried out in the corresponding `website_instance`'s directory (See [Working with website instances](#anchor--website-instances) section).

<!--/NOTE-->

<!--TICKETS-->

- Creating a new entity

  - pick a suitable entity type for the new content,
  - in **`permanent_storage`**:
      - enter entity manifest into the chosen `records_[entity_type].php` file,
      - if neccessary (e.g. lengthy content), create external files for specific
        fields' content in `content_files`, for each desired locale,
  - check correct entity setup by requesting the entity in `bare_data` mode.

- Creating a new page

  - in **`definitions`**:
      - add the new page's definition into `definitons_pages.php`,
          - (make the `page_id` the same as the entity's `instance_id`),
  - visit the _admin interface_ and **have the path&nbsp;caches rebuilt**,
  - check correct page setup by requesting the new paths (for each locale).

- Adding new menu items

  - in **`definitions`**:
      - add the new menu-item definitions in each desired locale's
        `definitions_menus_[...].php` files,
          - (make the menu `item_id` the same as the `page_id` it is pointing
            to),
  - check on the pages if the new menu items show, the links work, and `active`,
    and `active-trail` (if applicable) indications are working correctly, for
    each locale.

- Finishing touches

  - visit the _admin interface_ and have the XML sitemaps rebuilt,
  - update the `global_lastmod` value in `config.php`:
     - note that this step might be needed to be applied on the public site
       instance again, as the `config.php` should **not** be copied over upon
       deploy,
  - deploy changes onto live server.

<!--/TICKETS-->

**NOTE:** Any time a page is created, or an existing page's `page_id` or `paths`
values are changed, it is neccessary to **rebuild the path&nbsp;cache** (the task
is accessible via the _admin interface_).


## <span class="anchor" id="anchor--initial-deploy"></span>Steps for initial deploy onto public server over FTP

1. place the unpacked installation into the _staging_ directory on server,
2. check `director.php`:
  - check the `@ingroup configuration` section,
3. edit `config.php`:
  - review your config presets,
  - define 'staging' as `CONFIG_PRESET`,
  - look at everything else,
      - e.g. where do you want to serve jQuery from,
4. make sure that the **admin data handler is inaccessible** to the script
   (delete or rename its directory),
5. manually test the staging site,
6. edit again `config.php`, now setting `CONFIG_PRESET` to 'live'.
7. swap `index.php` with `503_index.php`,
  - check if the maintenance message is getting served,
8. empty the live site's directory
9. copy over the now-serving-503 `index.php`,
  - optionally check the live site for the maintenance message,
10. copy over everything else from the staging directory,
11. swap back the `index.php`s so that the real one is being used,
12. test live site.
13. Bonus: you can restore the stage site too so you will have a stage at hand:
  - swap back its index.php for the real one,
  - edit its config.php:
      - re-define `CONFIG_PRESET` as 'stage',
      - review other settings.
      - test stage site.

## <span class="anchor" id="anchor--deploying-changes"></span>Deploying local changes onto public server using FTP

<!--TICKETS-->

- To update content and settings:

  - Upload from **_public_** (if you have new items here, start with this):
      - `document_files`
  - Upload from **_private->website\_instance_**:
      - `cache`
      - `definitions`
      - `permanent_storage`
  - Upload from **_document root_**:
      - XML sitemaps
  - Edit the remote `config.php` to update the `global_lastmod` value in it.

- To update theme:

  - Upload from **_private->website\_instance_**:
      - `cache` (There are theme-related caches.)
  - Upload from **_public_**:
      - `shared_assets`
      - check if `libraries_frontend` has changed too
  - Upload from the **_theme_**:
      - `css`
      - `css-static`
      - `images`
      - `js`
      - `templates` &larr; Watch out for if the theme's or the system's template dir is being used.
      - `theme_settings.php` &larr; **NOTE:** don't forget to **bump the theme&nbsp;version** in it!

### Note: "what to do if I uploaded the local config.php"?

- The good news is, your site remains safe.
- The bad news is, an error message will take place of your site: "unrecognized domain name".
- The steps to fix this:
  - Edit the _remote_ config.php:
      - the Config Presets are fine, just the wrong preset is active.
      - Set the `CONFIG_PRESET` definition: it's likely you will find it being set to 'dev', while, likely again, it should be set to 'live',
      - review all the other settings that are not governed by the presets,
      - save, then test site.
