The system should have a basic set of templates here. You, however, can have
your own set of templates in your theme.

When creating a new theme, the recommended process is to copy this `templates`
directory into your theme, then set the corresponding setting in config.php to
signal for the app to use the instance located in the theme, then you can
customize the theme-based `templates` instance.
