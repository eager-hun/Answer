Place for libraries handled by Composer.

- The desired packages are enlisted in 'composer.json' in the project root.
- This path for downloads is also specified in 'composer.json'.
- Install packages by issuing the following command in the same directory where
  'composer.json' is present (the project root):

$ composer install

- NOTE: I may be mistaken, but it may help to allow like 1GB of memory usage for
  php before issuing this command (perhaps you will also want to allow the
  script several minutes of maximum execution time; I'm also informed that it's
  pretty normal for the process to run for well above a minute or two).
