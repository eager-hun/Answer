SMP stands for "Single Mock Page".

The example_website site instance has a so-called single_mock_page page
definition, that is a placeholder/kickstarter structure for quick prototyping
activities.

This is a theme accompanying that prototyping initiative. It really is just a
placeholder, to demonstrate how the prototyping toolkit comes together.
