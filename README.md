# Answer project

Website operating script study - written mainly in PHP - for simple and small
websites and prototypes.


## What to expect from the code

- On occassion, you might be able spot signs of the fact that I am an autodidact
  learner of coding and programming.
- The project's state is not much more than a living inventory of such features
  and concepts that were high on my priority list.
- There are a lot of unfinished features in it.
- It's an early mashup of ideas that evolved on the go, so, its way towards
  maturity mitht possibly lead - instead of via refactors - via ground-up
  redesign(s) and rewrite(s).


### Should you use it for anything?

It's likely that you wouldn't want to; this project is so early in its
development process that:

- it yet contains a range of suboptimalities that restrain productive usage
  (doing anything with it is pretty labour-intensive, actually),
- fixes and improvements might be added in a non-backward-compatible manner:
  - any effort based on an early instance of this codebase might end up isolated
    from future improvements, and thus possibly become deprecated very quickly.


## Maintenance and development

- No promises on the future maintenance and development of this project.
  - Note however: suggestions and dialogue are always preferred over
    out-of-the-blue pull requests.
- Consider it a development snapshot; expect non-backward compatible changes any
  time.

## About the name

- "Answer" as in answer to the situation where I didn't find any related
  existing project with wich I could have felt satisfied enough.
- Also, I came accross the word originally by wanting to call the project
  "Structured Answer Over HTTP" (which idea I have dropped later).
