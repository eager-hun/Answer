This directory here is optional.

The templates are read by default from /private/templates. They are also
referred to as (default) system templates.

To be able to "fork" the system's default 'templates' directory, copy its
contents into this one (but the README), then update the config.php's
corresponding value, signalling that you want to use the templates defined here,
in the theme.
