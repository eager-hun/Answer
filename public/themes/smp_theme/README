SMP stands for "Single Mock Page".

The example_website site instance has a so-called single_mock_page definition,
that is a placeholder/kickstarter structure for quick prototyping activities.

This is a theme accompanying this prototyping initiative. It really is a
placeholder, just to demonstrate how the prototyping toolkit comes together.
