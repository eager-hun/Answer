// normalize.css is being included via 'sass-css-importer' plugin.
// (It originally resides in '../../../libraries_frontend/'.)
// Gains are:
// 1. We don't have to modify the workflow in any ways for this. Bower
//    downloads the normalize.css package into the libraries_frontend dir, and
//    straight away, it can get hooked up into our 'master' stylesheet.
// 2. Thus, normalize's rules can be sent over in the request for styles.css
// 3. It will get 'uglified' along with the rest of the styles when we set
//    output_style = :compressed in config.rb.

// @import "CSS:normalize"; // In the public repo, I link this .css separately.
